# Use AI with Tech Dad (Antigravity-200)

Welcome to the official repository for the **Use AI with Tech Dad** website. This project serves as a central hub for AI news ("The Briefing"), technical tutorials ("The Lab"), and resources for the modern AI workflow.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, high-performance stack optimized for edge deployment:

-   **Framework**: [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
-   **Language**: TypeScript
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   **3D Graphics**: [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) / [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmndrs.assets/react-three-fiber)
-   **Deployment**: [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) (`@cloudflare/next-on-pages`)
-   **Theme**: `next-themes` (Dark/Light mode support)

## 🛠️ Local Development

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the site.

## 🌍 Deployment (Cloudflare Pages)

This project is configured for deployment on Cloudflare Pages using the Edge Runtime.

### Build Command
The custom build command handles the specifics of the Cloudflare adapter:

```bash
npm run pages:build
```

This command:
1.  Builds the Next.js app using `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`.
2.  Generates the `_worker.js` output.
3.  Creates an `.assetsignore` file to prevent upload errors.

### Configuration
-   **Output Directory**: `.vercel/output/static`
-   **Compatibility Flags**: `nodejs_compat`
-   See `wrangler.json` for detailed configuration.

## 🤖 AI Studio Workflow

This project utilizes a structured AI-driven development workflow located in the `ai-studio/` directory.

### Key Files in `ai-studio/`

1.  **`lead-web-architect-creative-director-system-instructions.md`**
    *   **Purpose**: These are the **System Instructions** used to configure the lead AI model in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
    *   **Role**: Defines the persona (Lead Web Architect & Creative Director), design mandate ("Tech Dark" aesthetic), and strict output guardrails. This file ensures the AI "architect" understands the vision before writing a single line of code.

2.  **`website-upgrade-plan.md`**
    *   **Purpose**: This is the **Implementation Plan** generated by the AI Studio model based on the system instructions.
    *   **Recommendation**: Just select "Next.js" preset and let Cloudflare detect the settings. It usually defaults to `npm run build` and output `.next`.

### Architecture Upgrade: Before vs. After

This diagram illustrates the evolution from the original manual workflow to the new automated system:

        Manual[Manual Upload]

        Files --> Manual --> Host1
    end

        Next -- "git push" --> Git --> Build --> Host2
    end

    style Build fill:#22c55e,stroke:#fff,color:#000
```

3.  **Verify**:
    *   Once deployed, Cloudflare will automatically rebuild your site whenever you push to GitHub, keeping your content fresh.

### The Workflow Loop
1.  **Define Vision**: Update the `system-instructions` in AI Studio.
2.  **Generate Plan**: Have AI Studio output a comprehensive `upgrade-plan.md`.
3.  **Execute**: Feed the plan to the Agent Manager to build the feature.
